# Sean Lucey's Résumé

This repository contains my Résumé - written and compiled in [LaTex](https://www.latex-project.org/), and published to this GitHub repo via a [GitLab pipeline](https://gitlab.com/seanlucey/resume)!

What began as a fun proof-of-concept has become a super nerdy way to distribute my résumé! I have built a pipeline that allows me to compile this LaTeX document from any computer without needing to rely on a third party service!
